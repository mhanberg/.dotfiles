These dotfiles are now managed using Nix on macOS and Linux.

macOS utilizes nix-darwin in order to manage homebrew dependencies, and both macOS and Linux utilize home-manager for dotfiles and nixpkgs.

I haven't yet set up a new computer with the Nix setup, so I don't have the fresh install instructions ready, but the maintenance instructions are documented.

## macOS

```bash
just darwin
```

## Linux

```bash
just hm
```
